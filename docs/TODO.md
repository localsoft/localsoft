To Do
=====

In order of priority.

- [ ] Refactor Person/People to use `input` type and get rid of `patch.mjs`
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Find abstraction for info/edit drawers on pages (much duplication)
- [ ] Have a look at [FlacheQL](https://github.com/FlacheQL/FlacheQL) for GQL caching
- [ ] Try out [tuql](https://github.com/bradleyboy/tuql) instead of our json file
- [ ] Syndicated posts to Twitter, Facebook
- [ ] Custom fields on `Person` record
